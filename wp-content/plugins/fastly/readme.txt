Integrates Fastly with WordPress publishing tools.

This is the official Fastly plugin for WordPress.

The official code repository for this plugin is available here:

https://github.com/fastly/WordPress-Plugin/

== Description ==
Usage:
1. To proceed with configuration you will need to sign up for Fastly (at fastly.com/signup) and create and activate a new service. Details of how to create and activate a new service can be found at Fastly's documentation. You will also need to find your Service ID and make a note of the string.
2. From Fastly's configuration interface, create an API token with the default scope and access level. Make a note of the credential. 
3. Set up the Fastly plugin inside your WordPress admin panel
4. Once the plugin is installed into your WordPress instance, you will need to enter your API token and Service ID into the plugin's configuration page. 
5. That's it! Everything should just work. In order to route production traffic through Fastly, you will likely need to change some records with your domain registrar. Refer to Fastly's documentation for more instructions about which CNAME records to use. 
6. In order to get the most value out of Fastly, you should create a number of VCL Snippets that let you define some custom logic for how the Fastly CDN should handle requests to your WordPress instance. You can add Snippets to your service from the side menu when editing the configuration of your Service version. These are the Snippets that you should create:

_Note: you may have to disable other caching plugins like W3TotalCache to avoid getting odd cache behaviour._

- Pulls in the [Fastly API](http://docs.fastly.com/api)
- Integrates purging in post/page/taxonomies publishing
- Includes an admin panel in `wp-admin`
- Integrates some of the advanced purging options from Fastly API
- Allows to monitor purging using webhooks for slack

Using this plugin means you won't have to purge content in Fastly when you make changes to your WordPress content. Purges will automatically happen with no need for manual intervention.

Customization:

Available wordpress hooks (add_action) on:

Editing purging keys output
 purgely_pre_send_keys
 purgely_post_send_keys
    functions: add_keys

Editing surrogate control headers output(max-age, stale-while-revalidate, stale-if-error)
 purgely_pre_send_surrogate_control
 purgely_post_send_surrogate_control
    functions: edit_headers, unset_headers

Edit cache control headers output (max-age)
 purgely_pre_send_cache_control
 purgely_post_send_cache_control
    functions: edit_headers, unset_headers

Example:
add_action(\'purgely_pre_send_surrogate_control\', \'custom_headers_edit\');
function custom_headers_edit($header_object)
{
  $header_object->edit_headers(array(\'custom-header\' => \'555\', \'max-age\' => \'99\'));
}

add_action(\'purgely_pre_send_keys\', \'custom_surrogate_keys\');
function custom_surrogate_keys($keys_object) {
    $keys_object->add_key(\'custom-key\');
}
