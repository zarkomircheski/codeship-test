Use Bitly generated shortlinks for all your WordPress posts and pages, including custom post types.


== Description ==

WP Bitly is the easiest way to replace WordPress shortlinks with Bitly links. Install the plugin, visit the settings page and authorize with your Bitly account, select the post types you'd like shortlinks generated for and that's all!

Shortlinks are a great way to quickly share posts on social media like Twitter, Instagram and Facebook. Just wrote an amazing post and want to share that post with your friend? It's a lot easier to text a shortlink than the full URL.

WP Bitly also provides some insights (via a metabox on your edit post screen) as to how your link is being passed around, and who's clicking on it.

= Coming Soon =

* More feedback from Bitly on how your link is generating leads
* Feature Requests are welcome via the [Support Forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/wp-bitly)


== Installation ==

1. From the *Dashboard* navigate to *Plugins >> Add New*
2. Enter "WP Bitly" in the search field
3. Select *Install Now*, click *OK* and finally *Activate Plugin*
4. This will return you to the WordPress Plugins page. Find WP Bitly in the list and click the *Settings* link to configure.
5. Authenticate with Bitly, select the post types you'd like to use shortlinks with, and you're done!


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= After installation, do I need to update all my posts for short links to be created? =

No. The first time a shortlink is requested for a particular post, WP Bitly will automatically generate one.

= What happens if I change a posts permalink? =

WP Bitly verifies all shortlink requests against Bitly. If the URL has changed it will see this and request a new shortlink.

= Can I include the shortlink directly in a post? =

The shortcode `[wpbitly]` accepts all the same arguments as the_shortlink(). You can also set a "post_id" directly if you wish.

= How do I include a shortlink using PHP? =

`wpbitly_shortlink(); // returns the shortlink for the current post`
`wpbitly_shortlink(42); // returns a shortlink for the page or post with ID 42`
